i have figured out how to use git. Got started on a decent chunk in my c++ class but still need to work on it as I am behind in the class. I am doing alright in descrete math, I need to memorize the equations orI'm going to be in trouble.

I have been catching up on my classes. I have gotten a 95/100 on my c++ test and am doing well in my other classes.

I have gotten all caught up and am not understanding my c++ that well right now

I took a couple days off from hw and am now behind a lot more than I thought I would be. im doing fine with all the code stuff though

I took a test in my discrete mathmatics class and have no idea how i did. I think I did alright but am hoping for an 85+. i am still behind in my servers class and finished my portion of the presentation in my 2450 class
