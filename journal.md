i have figured out how to use git. Got started on a decent chunk in my c++ class but still need to work on it as I am behind in the class. I am doing alright in descrete math, I need to memorize the equations orI'm going to be in trouble.

I have been catching up on my classes. I have gotten a 95/100 on my c++ test and am doing well in my other classes.

I have gotten all caught up and am not understanding my c++ that well right now

I took a couple days off from hw and am now behind a lot more than I thought I would be. im doing fine with all the code stuff though

I took a test in my discrete mathmatics class and have no idea how i did. I think I did alright but am hoping for an 85+. i am still behind in my servers class and finished my portion of the presentation in my 2450 class

I have finished some flyers and computer screen ads for the honors program and am satisfied with one of them and alright with another. I am now just waiting for my boss to check them off or give something to change about them before pushing them to the university to post around the school.

I am catching up in my classes before spring break to hopefully not half to do any work during it. I am mostly caught up in all of my classes except for my C++ class

This week I have a test in my c++ class. I have finished all the assignments and the practice test. I am hoping i do well. 

I am taking a descrete math test this week. I have been working a decent bit lately. I have started to be able to go to the gym consistantly again. I am a little worried about this descrete test but i am studying a decent bit for it.

I have taken the test and i feel like i did good on it. I am making a RSA encryption and decryption for that class now and it is a hard project. I have to start studying for my finals now and go a field trip for my geology class which is really stupid because it's worth 100 points.

I have fallen behind last week as I haven't done as much as i needed to do. I am now trying to catch up and study for my finals. I am a little nervous about my grades as I have them being really good or just good enough. I am working on the classes that are just good enough but I have gotten some high point assignments in the good classes that I also need to prioritize.

Last week before finals, cramming in everything I can. Gave my presentation in my 2450 class for my website. I have to keep studying for all my other classes to make sure I get good grades in all of them.
